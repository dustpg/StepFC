2.2 2005/03

===========
 * Added the `scale2x3' and `scale2x4' effects.

 * Fixed the scalebit.c implementation to be C++
   compatible [Max Horn]

2.0 2004/02
===========
 * Added a new revision of the `scale3x' effect. It now looks good as

 * Added a detailed algorithm specification in the `algorithm.txt' file.
 * Minor fixes at the scalebit.c file.

1.6 2003/07
===========
 * Added an example of the fast implementation of the effects
   applied to a generic bitmap. There is also an
   example for the not obvious Scale4x effect.
