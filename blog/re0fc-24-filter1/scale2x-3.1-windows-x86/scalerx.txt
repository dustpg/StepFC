   Scale a .PNG image using the reference implementation of the Scale effects
   ==========================================================================


SYNOPSIS
========

scalerx [-k N] [-w] [-r N] input.png output.png


DESCRIPTION
===========

Scale2x, Scale3x and Scale4x are real-time graphics effects
able to increase the size of small bitmaps guessing the
missing pixels without blurring the images.

They were originally developed for the AdvanceMAME project
in the year 2001 to improve the quality of old games running
at low video resolutions.

The specification of the algorithm and more details are at:

    http://scale2x.sourceforge.net

These command line tools read a .PNG file and write another
image with the effects applied.

The reference implementation of the Scale effects is used.


OPTIONS
=======

    -k N, --scale N
        Select the scale factor. Available values are 2, 2x3,
        2x4, 3, and 4.

    -w, --wrap
        Compute the image border for a wraparound effect.

    -r N
        Select a specific revision of the effect.
        The default is scaleX using algorithm 'x' or '1'.
        To select the new scaleK use algorithm 'k' or '2'.
        To scale an image without any effect use the value '0'.
        Other nunbers are alternative versions.
        Refers at the source implementation for more details.
